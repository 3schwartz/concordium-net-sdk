## Unreleased changes
- Align data structures like records, classes and structs to be used uniform throughout the library.
- Added ConfigureAwait where task are awaited on public API's.

## 2.0.0
- Rewrite the SDK to use the Concordium Node gRPC API version 2. This
  rewrite does not preserve any of the old API and therefore deprecates
  earlier versions of the SDK.

## 1.0.0
- Initial release.
