## Unreleased changes
- Added `GetBlockItemStatus` endpoint to clients and added helper classes `BlockItemSummary` and `TransactionStatus`.

- Rewrite the SDK to use the Concordium Node gRPC API version 2. The
  rewrite does not preseves the API and deprecates earlier versions
  of the SDK.

## 1.0.1
