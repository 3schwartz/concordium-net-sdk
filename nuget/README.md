# C# .NET SDK for interacting with the Concordium blockchain

This is a .NET integration library written in C# which adds support for constructing and sending various transactions, as well as querying various aspects of the Concordium blockchain and its nodes. This SDK uses version 2 of the [Concordium Node gRPC API](https://developer.concordium.software/concordium-grpc-api/#v2%2fconcordium%2fservice.proto) to interact with Concordium nodes and in turn the Concordium blockchain, and serves as a wrapper for this API with added ergonomics. 

Rendered documentation for this project is available [here](http://developer.concordium.software/concordium-net-sdk/)
